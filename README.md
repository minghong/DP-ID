# The codes are located in the **code** folder
Step 1 : run **sanke_like.py** to obtain the matriax of image

step 2 : run **dp-image_compression.cpp** to achieve dp-compress

step 3 ：run **encode.py** to convert the image matrix to bases

step 4 ：simlate DNA storage errors

step 5 : run **correct_length.py** to correct DNA sequence to 150nt
